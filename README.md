# 1f483 · The “Dancing men” animation 💃

**1f483** is a simple web app that makes a stick figure dance any text in English for you. The idea of “Dancing men” origins from the story [“The Adventure of the Dancing Men”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dancing_Men) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. What **1f483** does is replace a sequence of stick men with a single figure dancing in real time, letter by letter, thus producing a dance representation of a text you provide.

Visit the **1f483** project’s [homepage](https://amphiluke.github.io/1f483/) to play with the app. You can also provide your custom text to dance in the `text` query parameter, e.g. [https://amphiluke.github.io/1f483/?text=Elsie%20prepare%20to%20meet%20thy%20God](https://amphiluke.github.io/1f483/?text=Elsie%20prepare%20to%20meet%20thy%20God)
